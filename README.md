## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses historical sea level data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to visualize and predict sea level rise over time.

The goal is to:
- Plot the original data
- Draw two lines of best fit using linear regression
  - One based on all available data (1880–2050)
  - One based on data since the year 2000 (2000–2050)
